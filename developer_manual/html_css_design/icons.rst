List of available icons
=======================

.. deprecated:: 25

The icons available in the core/img/ folder of the server are deprecated. You can use them at own risk.
Due to a change of the way the list is produced now on the server it can no longer be automatically turned into documentation.

Please use `Material design icons`_ instead.

.. _svgcolorapi:

Svg color api
=============

.. deprecated:: 25

The svg API is not supported anymore due to performance reasons.

Please use `Material design icons`_ instead.

Material design icons
=====================

If you need more than the shipped default icons, using the material-design-icons would be a good idea.
