Files

.. sectionauthor:: John Molakvo√¶ <skjnldsv@protonmail.com>
.. versionadded:: 27

Since Nextcloud 27, the files app has been rewritten to use new standards
and frameworks. This means that the old documentation is no longer valid.
We will update and document the new files app APIs and methods here.

.. note:: Some external libraries offers in-depth technical documentation.
    Please have a look at the following:

    * https://github.com/nextcloud-libraries/nextcloud-event-bus (`documentation <https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-event-bus>`__)
    * https://github.com/nextcloud-libraries/nextcloud-files (`documentation <https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-files>`__)
    * https://github.com/nextcloud-libraries/nextcloud-upload (`documentation <https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-upload>`__)


Events
^^^^^^

To listen to files or folder changes or to trigger changes, you need to use
the ``event-bus`` and use the following events:

  * ``files:node:created``: the node has been created
  * ``files:node:deleted``: the node has been deleted
  * ``files:node:moved``: the node has been moved (and its data is already updated)
  * ``files:node:updated``: the node data has been updated

All these events use a Node as argument. You can use a webdav client (for example, by using the davGetClient function from `@nextcloud/files <https://nextcloud-libraries.github.io/nextcloud-files/>`__) to retrieve a node from a file's name.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: ts

  import type { Node } from '@nextcloud/files'
  import { subscribe } from '@nextcloud/event-bus'

  subscribe('files:node:created', (node: Node) => {
    console.log('Node created', node)
  })

Router
^^^^^^

To change views and parameters of the current Files app, we expose the router.
This directly maps to the Vue router. You can check their own `documentation <https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#navigate-to-a-different-location>`__ to
better understand the methods.

.. code-block:: ts

  /**
   * Trigger a route change on the files app
   * 
   * @param path the url path, eg: '/trashbin?dir=/Deleted'
   * @param replace replace the current history
   * @see https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#navigate-to-a-different-location
   */
  goTo(path: string, replace: boolean = false): Promise<Route>

  /**
   * Trigger a route change on the files App
   *
   * @param name the route name
   * @param params the route parameters
   * @param query the url query parameters
   * @param replace replace the current history
   * @see https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/navigation.html#navigate-to-a-different-location
   */
  goToRoute(
  	name?: string,
  	params?: Dictionary<string>,
  	query?: Dictionary<string | (string | null)[] | null | undefined>,
  	replace?: boolean,
  ): Promise<Route>


Examples
--------

.. code-block:: js

  OCP.Files.Router.goTo('/trashbin?dir=/Unsplash.d1680193199')
  OCP.Files.Router.goToRoute('fileslist', { view: 'files' }, { dir: '/Folders/Group folder' })
